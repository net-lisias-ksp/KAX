## Description

A Mod for Kerbal Space Program

Originally created by Keptin, then maintained by SpannerMonkey and the SM Industries team, and now under Lisias' Management, KAX is a pack of select vanilla-inspired parts for your aircrafting needs!

Included Parts:

- Turboprop
- Radial Engine
- Radial Engine Long Cowl
- Electric Propeller
- Helicopter Main Rotor
- Helicopter Tail Rotor
- Heavy Landing Gear
- Jump Jet Engine
- 2M Aircraft Cockpit
- 2M Fuselage (jet fuel)
- 2M Structural Fuselage (empty)
- 2M Tail Boom 

Extract the KAX folder, into your KSP Gamedata folder.  

Be sure to properly extract the Firespitter/Resources folder or you will have FScoolant errors on loading the electric prop.  

This mod Requires Firespitter and Module Manager to enable all the features. Please use the latest versions of their .dll plugins.


### Configuration

Now you can choose how to handle your KAX parts and future new enhancements by editing the file `<KSP_ROOT>PluginData/KAX/user.cfg` that will be automatically created by KAX on the first run.

#### VAB/SPH Parts Menu

You can choose between three options:

* New Advanced Menu
	+ `CategoryFilter = NEW`
	+ ![](./PR_Material/Config/CategoryFilterNew.png)
* Old, classic Menu
	+ `CategoryFilter = OLD`
	+ ![](./PR_Material/Config/CategoryFilterOld.png)
* No specialized menu at all
	+ `CategoryFilter = NONE`
	+ ![](./PR_Material/Config/CategoryFilterNone.png)

The new Advanced Menu has shows only KAX parts with submenus specialised by category:

![](./PR_Material/Config/CategoryFilterNewScreen.png)

The old, classic menu is an old friend: all KAX parts on the same category on the simplified menu:

People using [Community Category Kit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149840-discussion-community-category-kit/) would want to disable the menu at all, as CCK already handles all of that.


### Project Directives

This Management (Lisias) had agreed to oblige himself to the following directives for this project:

* **KAX will remain KAX**
	+ it will not be rolled into another mod
	+ it can be expanded
		- expansions must be in keeping with the tone of the mod
		- it must be vaguely (as much as possible) stockalike. 

This project aims to preserve the stock a like compatibility and versatility  of these parts, and any subsequent parts will be designed with that in mind.  The goal is that any new part will blend seamlessly with the current parts and add to rather than detract from the mods functionality.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are now on its own file (see the [In a Hurry](#in-a-hurry) section) and on the distribution file.
